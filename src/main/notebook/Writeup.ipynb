    "## Goal of investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to compare potential pubsub protocols with respect to utilized erasure coding scheme: \n",
    "- Reed-Solomon (RS) erasure coding\n",
    "- RLNC erasure coding \n",
    "\n",
    "The major advantage of RLNC over RS with respect to pubsub is the ability to combine any chunks and get a new validatable chunk. \n",
    "Thus way if a node has e.g. 2 (or more) arbitrary chunks then with RS coding the node need to choose which of chunks it wants to propagate, while with RLNC coding the node would just propagate a random linear combination of chunks. The latter should potentially significantly reduce the chance of propagating a duplicate info.        \n",
    "\n",
    "We also simulate an abstract pubsub protocol without any erasure coding which may be though as similar to the current Ethereum approach of blob dissemination (message chunks ~ DAS columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also consider [Ideal Pubsub](https://hackmd.io/@nashatyrev/rkXUsFD5a) model as a theoretical optimum for a pubsub protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider very simple network model and very simple pubsub protocol implementations where the only possible message is the raw message chunk. This simplicity should help in reasoning about why this or that statistical pattern is observed and also should help us to outline reasonable directions in developing a real life protocol.           \n"
