    "- To abstract from the actual bandwidth, message size and chunk count the _time_ is measured as a float value, \n",

    "    In other words the time `1.0` corresponds to the period of `numberOfChunks` rounds \n",
    "- The _latency_ is simulated in whole rounds (to keep the model simple). When the latency is non-zero the node \n",
